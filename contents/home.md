I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in [Prof. Lei Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~leichen/)'s team at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my Ph.D. in Data Science and Analysis from the Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies of HKUST ([AIS](https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/)) in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Lei Chen. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) and my Master's degree major in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I was advised by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Reinhart Gunther](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/reinhart-gunther).
